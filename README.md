# dreiklang

An explorative tool for classical music, this is an electron app, written using VueJS, that uses the API provided by https://openopus.org/ to suggest classical pieces of music at random. The app also keeps a history of viewed pieces and has a search tool to look up pieces by name or composer. The app uses pagination to allow a large number of results to be displayed in different pages.
